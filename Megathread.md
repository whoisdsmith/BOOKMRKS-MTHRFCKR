Never use thse to search for software, but when searching for other media types, take some [**preliminary measures**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide) to avoid running malware.

**Notes on software and sites to avoid:**

+ Try to avoid the pirate bay if you can (for software/games), it is filled to the brim with malware torrents. [Skulled users are not trustworthy either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/)

  + You can still use The Pirate Bay safely when searching for other media types (video, audio, etc.) [if you follow some basic steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide)

+ uTorrent [has bundled malware (a bitcoin miner) into the software in the past](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). The company developing this software is not trustworthy. Bittorrent (the torrent client) is owned by the same company.

+ [Bitlord \(torrent client\) is malware.](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1yb8kf/warning_do_not_download_bitlord_it_has_major/)

+ [Soda Stream is malware.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/8q2pg3/anyone_who_can_explain_why_soda_player_is/)

+ [Sidify/Allavsoft are scams - They are not able to download from spotify in any way, and instead record the streams or download from alternative platforms, like youtube.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/6l2lwh/any_experience_with_sidify/)

+ Peerblock is garbage and placebo software. Peerblock's blocklists are not accurate in any way and is not able to discern between the IP of a normal user and that of a copyright troll.
