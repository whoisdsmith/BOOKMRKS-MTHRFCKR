# /r/Piracy Rules

### 1. Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy

* 1a. No low effort submissions such as sharing seeding ratio screenshots are permitted.

&nbsp;

### 2. No spam, trading, selling, or blatant self-promotion posts

* 2a. No begging for invites to private sites, requesting for others to download content for you, requesting activation keys, etc.

* 2b. No dealing "cracked" (read: stolen) accounts or request for sites that do so

* 2c. Any monetary services are not allowed.

&nbsp;

### 3. Do not request for specific pirated titles (ie. a specific movie, book title, software title, etc.); do not link to pirated content. [Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/subfaq)

* 3a. You **may ask** generalized questions such as "Where can I find 4K movies, children's books, sci-fi books, etc.". You **may not** name a specific work's title in your content request.

* 3b. Do not link to specific pirated media. You **may link** to the top level of a site, eg. <https://1337x.to> but **never** to a specific pirated release, eg. <http://1337x.to/specific-movie-torrent>

* 3c. Do not encourage rule breaking by asking which specific title someone is looking for when they make a request

&nbsp;

### 4. Redundant questions that have been previously answered will be removed

* Do a custom search via google, example: `where to find cracked apps site:reddit.com/r/piracy`

&nbsp;

### 5. Do not direct-message moderators for help with your issues. Either message the mod team if relevant, or make a post on the sub as normal

* Set the recipient as /r/piracy to message the mod team instead of direct-messaging a particular mod
