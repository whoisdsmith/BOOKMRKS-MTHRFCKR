## Web Browsing Extensions

These are add-ons for your web browser which make your web experience ad-free, more private and streamlined.

Edge offers Sleeping Tabs, Startup Boost, Browser Sync, SmartScreen, Password Monitor, Tracking Prevention, Vertical Tabs, Collections, Web Capture, Immersive Reader and Automatic Coupon code finding during online checkout.
